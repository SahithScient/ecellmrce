 When you open the website the title is E Cell, MRCE ,and its logo in the browser tab. Moving to the first stage of the header you can find the logo and name as 
Entrepreneurship Cell Malla Reddy College of Engineering, Hyderabad. When you click this it will redirect you to the index page on which you are at present. Besides the name a location favicon is present, when you click on it with a popup downside it will show the college address. In the same way, a call icon and email icon mentioning the contact number and email of the organization.

The next is the menu or navbar which has E Cell, MRCE and More with dropdowns and the MRCE main website and Photo Gallery as linkage pages.

The remaining MRCE main website redirects to the college main website in a new tab and Photo Gallery redirects to the Gallery within the page.


The carousel of images slides is done with the help of CSS, JS ,and Bootstrap. The images have a fixed height and adjustable width and keep moving until the mouse click touches and does the same again.

The main announcement tab appears below the carousel with useful links and announcements. Followed by announcements, events and news come in one row. The announcements with the deadlines and links can help students. The event has a date canvas designed beautifully and the event name beside it. This keeps updated about the events within college and others. News tabs keep updated with the news like some success stories information and links. These three have a chevron left and right to move between the older and newer posts.

The final ending of the webpage is followed up with a beautiful canvas footer addressing the logo in between. The address of the college is again mentioned below and the news, announcements, events ,and home quickly jump to the middle if you are lost in the ling webpage anytime. Social media give a final touch with links to stay updated on social media.
